SVG Filter Maker is a tool to help you build out your SVG filters visually in a node graph editor.

## Known issues

-   Cyclic dependencies are mostly ignored, I'm not here to shame your ouroboros.
-   Terribly not responsive and terribly unusable on mobile or touch-only devices.
-   Using a lot of nodes leads to performance issues.

## Missing features

-   Save latest graph configuration so it can be restored upon repeat visits.
-   Create a shareable link of the current configuration.
-   Create a list of recipes that can be loaded into the filter maker.
-   Allow inserting a custom SVG into the preview window.

## Community ideas

- Added: [Eric Meyer](https://mastodon.social/@Meyerweb/111766970639600432) suggested it would make sense to be able to resize the preview section.
- Added: [Scott Kellum](https://typetura.social/@scott/111761480249714868) suggested the ability to preview the rendering of a filter at a specific node.
